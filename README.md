# Web-Dev-Assessment
## Description

The purpose of this challenge was to deploy a web application and multiple choice quiz with interactive components. The project demonstrated dynamic HTML and CSS code, using Javascript. 

Users upon selecting the start button would be prompted to answer each question in the series until reaching the final page where answers were scored and presented with the an option to record his initials.

The acceptance criteria were as follows: 
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score

All of the acceptance criteria were met and the site functions as expected.

I learned the ins and outs of the DOM while creating dynamic pages. Web APIs present a unique challenge wherein aspects of the HTML can be called on to perform functions based on needs. Furthermore, I realized (after the fact) how important naming conventions can be. In many cases the variables declared were quite similar, so much as that they were hard to distinguish at times. Specificity is critical when utilizing the DOM structure. Getting the arrays to work in the way I needed them too posed a unique challenge - I found that reformatting made for easier reference later on - I will be sure to follow that model in the future. Finally, I again realize how vital notation and formatting code are to developing applications. I am still working to make this a natural implementation piece during the build process. 
## Usage

The html, css, and js files can be used to understand the dynamic code that supports the application. A link to the mockup is listed below, for your convenience.
